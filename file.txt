Problem Statement 
Medical practitioners use survival models to explore and understand the relationships 
between a patient’s covariates (e.g., clinical and genetic features) and the effectiveness of 
various treatment options. Standard survival models like the linear Cox proportional hazards 
model require extensive feature engineering or prior medical knowledge to model treatment 
interaction at an individual level. While nonlinear survival methods, such as neural networks 
and survival forests, can inherently model these high-level interaction terms, they have yet to 
be demonstrated as effective treatment recommender systems. 
Personalized medicine (PM) aims to tailor disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to 
individuals based on their genes, lifestyle, and environment. This domain is currently 
dominated by supervised learning, which allows physicians to select from limited sets of 
diagnoses or estimate patient risk based on symptoms and genetic information. Patients and 
interested organizations may potentially play an important role in the realization of PM, 
which is closely related to better disease assessment and more effective treatments based on 
individual health data paired with predictive analytics. 
Background 
PM relies on building statistical models able to predict personalized treatments tailored to the 
characteristics of specific patients. Developing such statistical models calls for large amounts 
of patient data. However, in practice, patients often prefer not to divulge certain kinds of data 
due to privacy concerns. 
Medical researchers use survival models to evaluate the significance of prognostic variables 
in outcomes such as death or cancer recurrence and subsequently inform patients of their 
treatment options. A standard survival model is the Cox Proportional Hazards model (CPH), 
a semi-parametric model that calculates the effects of observed covariates on the risk of an 
event occurring (e.g., death). The model assumes that a patient’s log-risk of failure is a linear 
combination of the patient’s covariates, referred to as the linear proportional hazards 
condition. However, for providing personalized treatment recommendations, this assumption 
may be too simplistic. A richer family of survival models is needed to better fit survival data 
with nonlinear log-risk functions. 
Objectives 
1. Develop a Robust AI Model: 
o Utilize DeepSurv and Random Survival Forest (RSF) to create a reliable 
model that predicts personalized treatment recommendations based on patient 
data. 
2. Ensure High Predictive Accuracy: 
o Measure and optimize the model’s predictive accuracy using the concordance-
index (C-index), ensuring it effectively ranks patient survival times. 
3. Enhance Data Privacy and Security: 
o Implement stringent data privacy and security measures to protect patient 
information, addressing concerns about data sharing and confidentiality. 
4. Integrate with Existing Systems: 
o Design the software to seamlessly integrate with existing hospital information 
systems and electronic health records (EHRs) for smooth implementation. 
5. Provide User-Friendly Interface: 
o Develop an intuitive interface for medical practitioners to easily input patient 
data and receive actionable treatment recommendations. 

Architecture of DeepSurv 
To model nonlinear survival data, researchers have applied three main types of neural 
networks to the problem of survival analysis: classification methods, time-encoded methods, 
and risk predicting methods. This third type is a feed-forward neural network (NN) that 
estimates an individual’s risk of failure. Faraggi-Simon’s network is an example of a 
nonlinear extension of the Cox proportional hazards model. 
In this section, we explain the main methodology for providing personalized treatment 
recommendations using DeepSurv, an open-source Python module that applies recent deep 
learning techniques to a nonlinear CPH network. DeepSurv is defined as a prognostic model, 
and we demonstrate how to use the network’s predicted log-risk function to provide 
personalized treatment recommendations.

Experimental Design 
Dataset 
Datasets such as those from the Indian Council of Cancer Research (ICCR) and local 
hospitals will be used for experimentation and evaluation. 
Evaluation Measures 
Measures such as accuracy of prediction of hazards will be computed by comparing the 
proposed treatment and hazards with the ones prescribed by doctors. The concordance-index 
(C-index) will be measured to evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy on the survival data. 
The C-index is the most common metric used in survival analysis and reflects a measure of 
how well a model predicts the ordering of patients’ death times. 
Methodology 
Step 1: Data Collection and Dataset Preparation 
• Survival data will be collected from the ICCR dataset and local hospitals. 
• Activities: Secure necessary permissions and agreements, aggregate and preprocess 
the collected data to ensure quality and consistency. 
Step 2: Developing a DeepSurv-Based Treatment Recommendation System 
• A recommended treatment for each patient in the test set will be built using DeepSurv 
and the Random Survival Forest (RSF). 
• Without preselected treatment-interaction terms, the CPH model will compute a 
constant recommender function and recommend the same treatment option for all 
patients, effectively comparing the survival rates between control and experimental 
groups. 
• DeepSurv and RSF can predict an individual’s hazard per treatment by computing 
relevant interaction terms. 
Step 3: Training and Experimentation on Datasets 
• The DeepSurv model will be trained on large-scale datasets. 
• Activities: Implement the DeepSurv architecture, train it on the survival data, 
optimize model parameters, and compare performance against standard survival 
models. 
Step 4: Deployment and Analysis in Real-Life Scenario 
• The trained and tested recommender system will be developed in a real-life scenario 
where historical medical records of cancer patients will be collected from local 
hospitals. 
• Activities: Integrate the system with hospital databases for real-time data collection, 
monitor performance, gather feedback from medical practitioners and patients, and 
refine the system. 
 
 

Importance at National Level 
The development of a personalized treatment recommender system under the IndiaAI 
Mission is of great national importance. Personalized medicine is a transformative approach 
that can lead to more effective treatments, improved patient outcomes, and optimized 
resource allocation within the healthcare system. 
This initiative aligns with India's vision to become a leader in AI-driven healthcare 
innovations and addresses critical challenges in medical research, such as the need for robust 
statistical models to predict personalized treatments while respecting patient privacy 
concerns. Successful implementation could revolutionize clinical practices, enhance the 
precision of medical interventions, and contribute significantly to the nation's public health 
goals. 
India’s Healthcare Challenges and Statistics 
1. Healthcare System Ranking: 
o India ranks 112th out of 195 countries in the Global Healthcare Access and 
Quality (HAQ) Index. This low ranking highlights significant gaps in the 
quality and accessibility of healthcare services. 
2. Mortality Rates Due to Inefficient Treatments: 
o It is estimated that nearly 5.2 million people die each year in India due to 
medical errors and adverse effects of treatments. This includes deaths caused 
by incorrect diagnoses, wrong treatments, and ineffective management of 
chronic diseases. 
3. Cancer Statistics: 
o India reports over 1 million new cancer cases annually, with a significant 
proportion of patients receiving late diagnoses or inappropriate treatment 
plans. Personalized treatment approaches could potentially reduce mortality 
rates by ensuring timely and accurate treatment. 
4. Chronic Disease Burden: 
o The burden of chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and 
hypertension is rising in India. With over 77 million diabetics and increasing 
numbers of heart disease patients, personalized medicine can play a crucial 
role in managing these conditions more effectively. 
5. Hospital Resource Utilization: 
o Hospitals often face resource constraints, with many operating at full capacity. 
Efficient treatment recommendations can help optimize the use of these 
resources, reducing the strain on healthcare facilities and improving patient 
throughput.
